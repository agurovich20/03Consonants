Initially decided on a rough plan in class to have two methods, one binary one linear
to then have a play method that would play one of them and we would comment the other out (similar to some HW's)

t-- 0.5
We ended up scrapping this to instead have the same test run twice but using the Systme method "currentTimeMillis" between each mrthod run to see the length.
Our last addition was to also have multiple data sets to run through, varying in length. Added these to the plan

Fixed creation of arrays (thank u class issues)
fixed methods of binsearch and linsearch.

heard abt computer noise? not sure yet how to fix it.

Ran trials for our Data, discovered that a 10,000,000 trial took way too long given that our 1,000,000 trial alone took eight minutes to run, considered lowering trials but instead chose to look into smaller sizes ( 1,000 , 100, 10)
  Maintained data size while also expanding lower as opposed to higher

t -- 1.5
through gallery work discovered some things we ought add (check notes)
Added worst case scenario trials with the last element of the array being the target, which is the worst case for both methods, ran trials for these.
labelled binWorst and linWorst, printed averages for these as well.
