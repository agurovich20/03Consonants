Initially decided on a rough plan in class to have two methods, one binary one linear
to then have a play method that would play one of them and we would comment the other out (similar to some HW's)

t-- 0.5
We ended up scrapping this to instead have the same test run twice but using the Systme method "currentTimeMillis" between each mrthod run to see the length.
Our last addition was to also have multiple data sets to run through, varying in length. Added these to the plan
