L03 -- Get empirircal --  test for binary over linear speed
2021-12-22
time spent:  8.0

 DISCO:
- Use of Comparable Arrays over int arrays, that binarys success may be only on comparable arrays? 
- running thousands of trials is as easy as adding a loop
- use of outside classes for methods is much more efficent and provides MUCH cleaner code.

QCC: 
- why is there any fluctuation in the times per test at all, what is the error that can be causing it?
      considering 'human error' isn't a factor
- why does this take time if an image is this to a billion extent? Shouldn't this, even at massive scales, be instantaneous?

GALLERY TOUR:

Other groups had used much more trials than us, so we added a much larger integer for trials, (100,000);

decided that a best case scenario trial was negligible as numbers seemed random and very uninformative.

Should get avergae from dividing by number of trials not size of the array (makes way more sense).

Range of results are very similar to range in the luckiest and unluckiest situation.

Finding stadnard deviation can be difficult.
