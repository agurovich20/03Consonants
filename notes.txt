 DISCO:
- Use of Comparable Arrays over int arrays, that binarys success may be only on comparable arrays? 
- running thousands of trials is as easy as adding a loop
- use of outside classes for methods is much more efficent and provides MUCH cleaner code.

QCC: 
- why is there any fluctuation in the times per test at all, what is the error that can be causing it?
      considering 'human error' isn't a factor
- why does this take time if an image is this to a billion extent? Shouldn't this, even at massive scales, be instantaneous?
